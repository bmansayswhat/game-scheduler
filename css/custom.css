##BOOTSTRAP!
Almost all styling can be handled with Bootstrap's classes
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/borders/

There's also a ton of ways to extend bootstrap, so chances are,
what you want to do can be handled by bootstrap.

If there's something absolutely not available via bootstrap,
you can create custom classes here and then add them to your
html elements.

##ICONS!
The font awesome icon library is included on each page, so you
can add any of their icons.
